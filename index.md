ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my blog!

Hi, this is Charlie. I'm documenting my notes and some small writeups in this blog. I'm currently working on a research team at Xapien specialising in Language Model interpretability, performance and operations. 

Sorry in advance for all of the grammar mistakes, hopefully it's all legible!
